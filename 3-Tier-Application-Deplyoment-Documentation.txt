3-Tier-Application-Deplyoment

First:- Let's deploy and test our application locally/on other server.

- Build another Server for deployment.

- Now build a account in Cloudinary
{Cloudinary is a cloud-based media management platform mainly used by developers and businesses to handle images, videos, and other media files.}
https://console.cloudinary.com/app/c-ac3c84e29858ff6744bd5aaa621dfb/home/dashboard

- Now Build a account in Mapbox
{Mapbox ðŸ‘‰ Itâ€™s a cloud-based service that provides APIs and SDKs for adding interactive maps, geolocation, navigation, and location-based data visualizations in web and mobile applications. Developers use it as an alternative to Google Maps.}
https://console.mapbox.com/account 

- Now Build Database -- Cloud Based
{We can use both Cloud based or container DB}
  - Build a account in mongo atlas
    {MongoDB Atlas is the cloud version of MongoDB, offered as a Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS).}
    Make accessable the whole DB 
    https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/68c29138193ae36a2d4b05b8#/security/network/accessList

Second: Setting up enviroment
What to write in a .env file
# Cloudinary credentials for image and video management
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dttx62muu
CLOUDINARY_KEY=582533422215331
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=AGUKXi3793alvxvrhcAnZbZv6Cs

# Mapbox token for location-based services
MAPBOX_TOKEN=sk.eyJ1Ijoia2FyYW4tbmVnaS0xMiIsImEiOiJjbWZmNmg2ODAwZGFxMmtyOXlzczNhYmRmIn0.px2xckSNADpFA4hIsgHSNA

# Database connection string
DB_URL="mongodb+srv://karan:Kafka@#PDM2212@k-cloud-mongo-db.bxy9730.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=K-Cloud-Mongo-DB"
# Secret key for application security
SECRET=karannegi


Third: Deploy Local
git clone ..
npm start 

edit the file as per the images


Fourth: Deploy it
Setup Jenkins/SonarQube
Configure tools on Jenkins tools section 
Install trivy on Jenkins 

Genrate SonarQube token -> add this to credential of Jenkins

For trivy fs step we first need to generate a file then do the need full,

access the container from local laptop












for kbernetes:

in master we need to create a service account and then we create a role then assign that service account to the role via bind. then creta a token/secret


service account -> role ->
